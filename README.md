# Tiny C Projects

## Context

I'm reading Tiny C Projects, written by Dan Gookin.

## What I'd like to achieve

I want to add to this repository each tiny project with explanations.

"The best way to learn programming is to use small demonstration programs. Each one focusing on a specific part of the language."

## Compiler of choice

I'm using gcc to compile c code to executable programs.
`gcc -Wall main.c -o main`

The -Wall flag enables all compiler's warning messages.
The -o option enables us to choose our executable's name (in our example, it will generate a main.exe file)
